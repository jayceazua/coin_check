# Proposal

#### Use case
[coming soon...]


#### Problem:
Throughout your military career, you might be luck enough to come accross challenge coins or also known as challenge medallions. You will get coin checked by a superior or someone famous within the ranks and you hold that coin throughout your entire life. Valuable memory to hold. Problem is that they sometimes get lost, or people make fakes, or lie about how they received these challenge coins. 

#### Solution:
Military Challenge Medallion Foundation or Military Coin Check allows for military personnel to keep their authenticate coins in check. We keep a ledger of every coin they ordered and to who it was given to. Also, each coin depending on who it is will hold a value to later donate to an organization of your choice.
